# What are GitHub Gists and How to Use Them

**GitHub Gists** is a tool developed by GitHub which provides a simple way to share code snippets with other people. Gist snippets work similar to a conventional GitHub repository, in that they can be forked and cloned; each gist is a repository. They can also be public or secret, and even be created without the need of a GitHub account.

GitHub Gists has become a valuable tool among the developer community since it supports multiple features such as version control, commenting, snippet embedding in websites and quick setup without the need to create a repository.

Also, it provides a more minimal approach to GitHub repositories, since it does not support issues, pull requests, projects or actions.

In this article, we will discuss how to use Gists, their different features, main use cases and some examples.

## Use cases
There are multiple use cases for GitHub Gists. Because of its versatility and simplicity:
- We can use them for quickly sharing code snippets with other people.
- We can embed them in our website, something that a conventional GitHub repository does not allow by default.
	- We can use an HTML embed link and the snippet will automatically display along with a code window.
	- They're also supported by practically every content management software (*Medium included*)
- We can use them to display tabular data by using a `.csv` extension. These will render as actual tables when embedded.

## How to use GitHub Gists?

### 1. Creating a new gist
We can create a new gist by heading to the [GitHub Gists homepage](https://gist.github.com/).

From there, we can then define a gist description. This is equivalent to the *repository description* field on GitHub:

We must also include a file name with its extension for Gists to be able to provide syntax highlighting and proper formatting:

The, we can input the gist content:
