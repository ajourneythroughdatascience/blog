Last Sunday my personal computer broke. More specifically, the factory NVMe SSD burned out, and with it, all the programs and configuration files I had installed over the course of months.

For some people, this might not be so big of a deal; if we were lucky enough to have OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage service enabled, there's nothing to worry about, right? We just send it for repair, read a few books in the meantime, and then, when it's finally done, just plug and play.

Everything's in the cloud this days, so there's really nothing to worry about. Except, when we had programs, environments, an entire Tex Live distribution that took 12 hours to download, configuration files carefully crafted after hours of tinkering to customize to the very detail that PowerShell terminal we all love, that VS Code custom color scheme we spent hours designing, or even worst, the Linux configuration files in our [WSL2](https://pabloagn.com/technologies/wsl2/) environment. Yeah, those are sometimes not included in a cloud backup since most of the times they're either found on the inaccessible realms of the system-level `C:\` drive directories, far away from the `Users` folder, or in an entirely different drive as is the case of WSL2.

These are relatable problems, because indeed, computer failure never happens, until it does.

In this article, we discuss preventive measures for computer failure, crisis management techniques, and a little bit of humor (*now that the worst part's over and I can laugh at it, nervously*).

We'll be using scripts which can be found in theÂ [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/productivity-and-workflow/computer-failure-prevention-and-crisis-management).

# The Zero Hour

## 1. Damage assessment & diagnostics

### 1.1 BIOS

### 1.2 Peripherals


## 2. Simple potential solutions
Some of the times, the cause of death is solvable by simply going into BIOS mode and tweaking some parameters, dusting or reconnecting an internal hard drive, etc. Still, the internet is always a good resource if used wisely. Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora, etc.

## 3. Integrity verification
So, the computer's dead and we've tested everything we can. What now? Well, if we had a cloud storage service enabled, remote GitHub repositories, ...

### 3.1 Hard drive

### 3.2 Cloud storage integrity verification

### 3.3 GitHub remote repositories


## 4. Repair
It's inevitable and we have to send our machine to repair. There are a couple of options we can use:
- Aa
- Aa
- Aa
- Aa

# Preventive measures

## 1. Cloud storage


## 2. Backup disk images
- External hard drives
- Network drives

# Crisis management prep kit
Most of the tools suggested here are meant to be handy when no external support is available. Most IT support companies have wide availabilities (*even during weekends*) because these things happen unexpectedly. Still, sometimes we might need faster response times, or would like to spare a buck or two and do it by ourselves. (*Disclaimer: The steps below are mere suggestions and should be taken under each one's consideration. Some of them can permanently damage a computer and/or void warranty if done incorrectly. If in doubt, always call an IT support company*)



## 1. Machine information
This might seem a bit obvious but there's a high probability that we don't have the required information at hand in order to properly inform an IT technician about our machine. This isn't critical since most of the computer manufacturing companies include at least some of this information accessible without having to turn on the computer.

### 1.1 Serial number

### 1.2 Model name

### 1.3 Hardware specifications

### 1.4 Receipts or invoices


## 2. Hardware tools
## 3. Ethernet cables
## 4. Bootable USB drive

# Conclusions
We've reviewed multiple yet simple mechanisms we can employ to make our code cleaner, more elegant, modular, usable, scalable and safer. These measures can not only help us become better programmers but better collaborators. It will make reading code a pleasure instead of an agonizing process and instantly boost our credibility.
