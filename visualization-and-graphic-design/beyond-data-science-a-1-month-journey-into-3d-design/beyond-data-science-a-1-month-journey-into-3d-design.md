I've always been inclined towards creating new things; I guess it's an innate characteristic many engineers have. The process of conceptualizing an idea, planning its development, creating it, and iterating over and over again until it's almost perfect is what drives most of my work. A couple of months ago I decided to approach creation from a different angle. 

Writing code is one way of creating, sure, but unless we're doing FE, data visualization, or interactive design, there's no tangible, visual result; there's no aesthetic quality apart from the code itself. Moreover, data visualization, as done in BI, possesses a rigid nature; it's too sober and not artistic enough for my taste.

This is why I decided to give 3D design a try. I guess I was always curious about

# Part I. Inspiration
Every creative project starts with an idea, and 3D design is no different. I've never been a fan of animation, and I never intended to create an animation in the first place. In fact, the original idea was to create objects; 3D objects, maybe with a hint of movement, a looped animation, but not much more than that.

## 1. Arcane
That is until I watched [Arcane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmAurh012s), the brilliant 9-episode animated series based on Riot Games' League of Legends. This gave me a hint of what could be done in the 3D world, but still it was way out of my League and too much of a stylized realistic style for my taste; I wanted to see what could be done in the world of photorealism in a more approachable manner.

## 2. Jibaro
The next stop was [Alberto Mielgo](http://www.albertomielgo.com/)'s [Jibaro](). I instantly fell in love with this [Love Death + Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUFwunMKa4E) episode in each and every aspect; the realistic but yet unrealistic style (one could say magical realism with hyperrealism mixed), the sound, the beautiful nature scenes, the water simulations, and above all, the characters. Jibaro's characters were enthralling, magnetic, and human.

I now knew a new facet of 3D animation.

## 3. Oklou, iamamiwhoami - IONNALEE, Coals
The next & final stop, at least in this initial inspiration stage, were three of my most cherished contemporary artists:
- Oklou (Marylou Mayniel), France
	- [unearth me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQa8Dadmj7Y)
	- [god's chariots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvlJ3keIJdw)
- iamamiwhoami - IONNALEE (Jonna Lee), Sweden
	- [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJBC8L3pG_Y)
	- [hunting for pearls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJxXYHQIF40)
- Coals (Katarzyna Kowalczyk, Łukasz Rozmysłowski), Poland
	- [FIVE PIECES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h8V_tE8GAY)

All of these brilliant creators expertly introduced these beautifully surreal, cinematic, haunted & nostalgic nature settings & atmosphere, and that provided the final piece I needed to build the conceptual envelope & aesthetic quality of this project.

# Part II. Learning 3D Design

## 1. Picking a Software

## 2. What is Blender?

## 3. Why Blender?


---

# Part III. Building the Scene


## 1. Designing a Scene Layout
Now that I had all the atmosphere concept & knew basic Blender workflows (very basic), I could start creating some simple scenes by myself.

When talking about 3D scenes, we refer to settings that are created 

### 1.1 Landscaping Mountains in Blender

### 1.2 Landscaping Mountains in Gaea

### 1.3 Landscaping a Lake in Blender

### 1.4 Introducing a Biome

### 1.5 Introducing Fauna
Sadly enough, Biomes in Blender don't come with fauna included; for this, I needed to source some 3D assets. The problem was that animals with decent texturing, rigging & animation are expensive, very expensive.

### 1.5 Putting everything together

---

## 2. Designing a Character

### 2.1 Concept


### 2.2 Clothing


### 2.3 Rigging 


### 2.4 Weight Painting


### 2.5 Animating


---

## 2. Simulating Particles
While we already discussed static particle systems (implementing biomes), dynamic particle systems involve a particle emitter frequently bound to the laws of physics. These are a huge deal in 3D design, and can be used for a wide variety of applications. Below are some examples:
- Creating a general atmospheric ambiance within a scene.
- Generating realistic flying insects.
- Simulating various weather phenomena, such as precipitation and snowfall.
- Emulating fire embers using fire emitters.
- Simulating burning fragments or sparks in explosive fire effects.

So in short, dynamic particle systems are used to simulate any phenomenon that requires particles with some type of force affecting the instances.

### 2.1 Particle Emitters

### 2.2 External Forces
- Gravity
- Wind
- Turbulence
- Attractive Forces
- Repeller Forces


Up until now, there are three main ways we can create particles in Blender:
- Built-in particle simulator
- Simulation nodes
- Geometry nodes

## 3. Simulating Fluids
If there is one other type of simulation that is key to animation, is fluid simulation. This technique refers to the emulation of any type of fluid, and is typically bound to  

Up until now, there are three main ways we can create fluid simulations in Blender:
- Built-in particle simulator (mantaflow)
- Simulation nodes
- Flip Fluids

# Part VII. Creating Volumetrics
Volumetrics are one of the most important

# What I Learned
- Stylize your scenes if uncanny valley starts creeping in your projects.
- Don't tackle more than you can handle, specially if this is a first project.
- Nature is hard to design, specially forests. They are extremely complex environments, with lots of moving parts.
- Always use 2D when you can get away with it.
- Don't use 4K textures unless it's absolutely necessary. 2K does the job for many situations.
- Creating massive 3D landscapes is only useful when you're trying to walk over the entire thing.
- Character animation is hard, and specially when the character is photorealistic, or trying to emulate a real person.
- Appropriate lighting can turn a crappy scene into a fairly descent scene. In contrast, crappy lighting will most definitely turn a professional-looking scene into being unusable.
- Stick with the simple first. This will provide with sufficient preview power of what a project can look like.
- Constant previews are absolutely essential for creating a quality project.
- Don't overthink it.

# Conclusions


We must never let our creativity get dormant.
