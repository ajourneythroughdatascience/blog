Learning to program can be challenging, particularly finding the right learning resources. There is too much content and thousands of options from where to choose. This poses a question that many wonder when starting to write code: Who

It's specially difficult whenever we're starting to write code: we don't yet have the expertise or criteria to say, well, this was a nice tutorial. Because we don't know how difficult should language A or B be, and how difficult a given tutorial was to us, regardless of the content being explained. 

It's also difficult to find the whole package: an instructor that knows what she/he is talking about to the bone, knows how to explain it properly, presents it clearly and in a concise manner, has the adequate screen & voice recording skills, has an engaging voice,  has engaging/cutting-edge material, and many more traits. In the end, we'll be listening to this person for hours and hours straight.

In this segment, I'm going to go over 10 of the most professional, well-versed, technical, accurate, clear, and concise instructors available for free in the field of computer science and software development that have completely sold me on their method and material. Keep in mind that this is all my personal opinion. Also, this content is not sponsored in any way; the people I'm including in this segment deserve to be heard and supported because I believe their content is currently the best anyone can get for free.

Also, ordering is random and does not represent preference of any kind.

# Programming
## Derek Banas
Main channel: 
Languages / Technologies covered:
Top traits:  


## Marco Russo & Alberto Ferrari

## Curbal

## Scott Hanselman
This guy has got to be the most precise and sarcastic instructor I've had the pleasure to consult. The information is exact, and remarks are executed exactly when they're supposed to be executed. This guy is surgical, period. 

Beginners beware, he will bulldoze you, it happened to me. It happens so often...thinking ohh, it surely must be this way, he's about to say it, and then, bam, he drops it. 


## Brodie Robertson
I started watching Brodie's channel back when he had just a few subscribers. His Linux tutorials were just golden. He has now become an authority in the Linux community, and has written multiple software ranging from CLI-based applications to ...

## Derek Taylor 
Main channel: Distro Tube

## Luke Smith
I actually learned Arch Linux from this guy.
- Extremely well-versed
- Sarcastic
- Politically-inclined (and he happily lets us know)

## Chris Titus

## Andrew Ng


## Honorable mentions
I wanted to keep this list strictly at 10 instructors, but there is no way I can fit all the experts I've learned from in just 10 slots.

Also, there are some channels that I have not had the pleasure to visit in full depth, but from what I've consulted, they would definitely fit into the list.

Mentions:
- Let's Get Rusty
- Golang Dojo
- Tina Huang
- Tiff in Tech
- Lex Fridman
- Internet Made Coder
- Kevin Stratvert
- Dorian Dot Slash
- Christian Lempa


# Getting to know the industry
Not everything about programming is programming. Yep, I said that right. When learning to write code, we need to be aware of what's currently happening in the industry; what are the relevant languages today, how is the technology evolving, how many employees Google laid off in January. All that good stuff.

## 1. Stefan Mischook

## 2. Dorian Develops
Dorian has taught me lessons that I will never forget. He's a self-taught developer that speaks the truth about programming and the corporate world, and I think thousands of persons are very fond of him. Great knowledgeable guy with a lion heart.

# Conclusions
We've reviewed multiple yet simple mechanisms we can employ to make our code cleaner, more elegant, modular, usable, scalable and safer. These measures can not only help us become better programmers but better collaborators. It will make reading code a pleasure instead of an agonizing process and instantly boost our credibility.
