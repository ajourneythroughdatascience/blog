# A Journey Through Data Science

After a lot of tinkering, my personal technical blog, A Journey Through Data Science, is up and running!

I wanted to introduce it to the world by talking about its scope, the motivations behind it, what to expect, how to contribute, and much more.

In parallel, I've also launched a Showroom where you will be able to consult the single and collaborative projects I work on, a GitHub Gists account containing all the embedded snippets included in the articles, a revamped GitHub profile with all the source code included in the blog, and a Discord Server that will one day, hopefully, grow into a great community of enthusiasts.

There's already some content, and the idea is to publish weekly.

Hope you enjoy reading as much as I did building it!
