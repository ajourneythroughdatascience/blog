# About this series
As 2023 draws to a close, I've been thinking about the flood of news and opinions we're exposed to daily. It's a lot. Everywhere we turn, there's talk about economic downturns, social upheavals, environmental crises, full-scale wars, or increased polarization. And if you're anything like me, this constant flow of information can leave you feeling anxious, hopeless & misinformed. Are things really as bad as they sound? Are they better or worst? Are we getting the whole story, or just fragments shaped by the loudest voices? Which sources of information are we consulting? Are they first-hand, second-hand, third-hand, or entirely made up? Turns out, some of these questions can be answered by reliable data and its interpretation.

Over the last five months, I've dug into the task of creating a data repository filled with gigabytes of reliable data from credible sources – a quest that's been equal parts daunting and enlightening. What I've found is a wealth of information that doesn't often make it into the daily news cycle, data that can help us see beyond the headlines and draw our own conclusions.

I'm not an economist by any stretch. I'm simply someone who's curious and a bit tired of all the misinformation and how it affects our capacity to focus resources on what really matters. Each week, for the next five weeks, I'll share my findings with you, examining different aspects of our world's current state – not to add to the noise, but to help us all make sense of it.

# What to expect 
We'll look at a lot of data from reliable sources like [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home), [UN](https://www.un.org/en/), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), [ILOSTAT](https://ilostat.ilo.org/), [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/), and much more. I'll be learning right alongside you, breaking down complex economic concepts into something slightly more digestible. I'll always provide the raw data appropriately cited so you can always draw your own conclusions and use it however you want. We'll discuss a lot of different indicators under the most relevant topics. We'll explore beyond our own backyards, comparing how different countries are doing.

The goal? To equip ourselves with better tools for critical analysis. To move beyond anxiety-inducing headlines and understand the broader context – historical patterns, global comparisons, and more. By the end of this series, I hope we'll all feel a bit more grounded and informed. Not just about the bad news, but about the paths to improvement and the many facets of our world that often go unnoticed.

For this series, we'll be mostly using Python & VS Code, however, we'll also include some R when more in-depth statistical methods are required.

# Environment set up
As usual, let us start by setting up an environment.

Install `virtualenv` package:
```PowerShell
pip install virtualenv
```

Create virtual env:
```PowerShell
cd the-state-of-our-world-in-2023\src; virtualenv venv --python='C:\Users\Pablo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe'
```

Create `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas
numpy
xlsxwriter
scipy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
tensorflow
ipykernel
```

Install requirements
```PowerShell
 .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt; deactivate
```
