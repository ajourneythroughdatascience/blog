Writing code can be as simple as importing the required libraries, declaring our variables, functions, and classes as required, including some docstrings here and there, some additional comments, executing, and we're done. While we're at it, let's skip the function & class part and drop everything as is. Even better, let's also save some lines by stripping our file from all comments.

In this Blog Article, we'll

We'll be using JavaScript code which can be found in theÂ [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/computer-science/javascript-for-beginners).

# A historical context
JavaScript was developed in 1995 by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich). Funny enough, the language was developed in just 10 days, and changed names 3 times (*from Mocha to LiveScript to JavaScript*). The original idea of JavaScript was not that of a robust language, but a simple scripting language aimed to be used by designers performing simple tasks.

JavaScript was named after Java, but not because it had things in common with the latter, but to gain wider recognition & acceptance among the already-pissed developer community.

# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is currently the most popular language out there; it's estimated than over than 95% of the websites use it in one way or another. This is because it has become the de-facto language for developing reactive the front-end of applications; sure, we can design a static webpage using HTML & CSS exclusively, but we would lack the interactive component that makes reactive websites do what they do.

The first use-cases of JavaScript were actually the things we hate today in interactive websites: popups. Currently, JavaScript supports a wide range of capabilities due to its extense development over time. This is further enhanced by the emerging of frameworks, which are simply JavaScript libraries containing pre-written code created to facilitate development.

There are two main ways JavaScript is used, at least in the front-end development context:
- For building web-based applications
- For building desktop applications, more specifically, cross-platform

The first one can be achieved by employing a wide variety of frameworks, and even vanilla JavaScript, while the second one can also be achieved using the vanilla version, but also by using a popular framework called [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

# Installation
For this segment, we will need to install four main components:
- The JavaScript programming language.
- Visual Studio Code.
- JavaScript VS Code extension.
- HTML & CSS VS Code extension.

We will also install some packages, which will come later when we get to the dependencies section.

The installation and setup will be focused on the Windows operating system. Still, a similar process can be used for macOS or Unix-like platforms.

## 1. JavaScript
We will first install the latest stable release of the JavaScript programming language. 

We can verify our Elixir installation by opening a new PowerShell prompt and typing the following:

##### **Code**
```PowerShell

```

If all goes well, we should get something like this, depending on the version we installed:

##### **Output**
```

```

## 2. VS Code
If we don't yet have VS Code installed, we can get it from the [official downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). We need to select the Windows 8, 10, 11 executable and wait for it to download. When the installation is complete, we can verify by opening the Visual Studio Code application directly from the Windows start menu. A detailed configuration guide for VS Code is out of the scope of this article but can be consulted on the [VS Code official documentation site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

## 3. VS Code extensions
Once we have JavaScript and VS Code installed, we will proceed to install the JavaScript and HTML & CSS VS Code Extensions:
1. Open VS code and head to the Extensions menu in the left panel. We can also open the Extensions menu by using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> or by opening the command palette by typing <kbd>F1</kbd> and searching for *Extensions: Install Extensions*.
2. We will search for `Babel JavaScript`, maintained by *Michael McDermot*, install it, and enable it. We can also get the extension using [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel).
3. We will then search for `HTML CSS Support`, maintained by *ecmel*, install it, and enable it. We can also get the extension using [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css).

Now that everything's in place, we're ready to start configuring our working environment.

# Preparing our environment


# DOM
Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for HTML/XML documents. This component is key, since it helps JavaScript understand what's written inside an HTML document.
