Scala is a powerful, compiled, strong statically typed, high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Its demand has grown over the last years because of the powerful features it offers: Hybrid programming, type interface, immutability, pattern matching, higher-order functions, extensibility, interoperability with Java, and scalability, are just some of the main functionalities offered by the language. 

In this Blog Article, we'll discuss what Scala is, why it's relevant today, how it was built, and its main characteristics. We'll then compare Scala with other similar general-purpose languages such as Java, Haskell, F#, OCaml, and more. We'll also highlight Scala's main advantages over other general-purpose languages such as Python, Rust, and Go. Next, we'll talk about popular engines built on Scala, such as Apache Spark, Akka & Apache Kafka. We'll close this segment with next steps for those interesting in starting to learn this powerful language. 

We'll be using Scala code which can be found in theÂ [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/computer-science/the-scala-experience-a-fusion-of-power-and-elegance).

# Main features

## n. Compiled

## n. Hybrid programming
Scala was designed to be both object-oriented and functional. It is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object and functional language in the sense that every function is a value. The name of Scala is derived from word scalable which means it can grow with the demand of users.

## n. Extensibility

## n. Interoperability with Java
Scala is not an extension of Java, but it is completely interoperable with it. While compilation, Scala file translates to Java bytecode and runs on JVM (*Java Virtual machine*).
